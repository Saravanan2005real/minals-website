## About the Project

Minals (Ramaiah Enterprises) is a legacy brand with 60+ years of manufacturing excellence. This website serves as the company's official digital presence, showcasing their product catalogue, dealer network, and contact information.

Built with **Next.js 16 App Router**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v3**, the site is fully server-rendered — meaning every page is generated on the server before it reaches the browser, ensuring fast, reliable performance with no flash on navigation.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start local development server with Turbopack |
| `npm run build` | Build the app for production |
| `npm start` | Run the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the project |

---

## Design System

All brand tokens are defined in `tailwind.config.ts` as custom Tailwind colors:

```ts
colors: {
  primary:      '#002B5B',   // Deep navy blue — brand primary
  secondary:    '#B8860B',   // Dark gold — prices, accents, CTAs
  accent:       '#D4AF37',   // Bright gold — hover states
  'text-main':  '#333333',   // Body text
  'text-light': '#666666',   // Muted / secondary text
  'bg-light':   '#f9f9f9',   // Light page backgrounds
}
```

**Usage in JSX — no CSS files needed:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-primary text-white px-5 py-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-secondary">
  Click me
</div>
```

**Typography:**
- **Primary Font** — `font-inter` (Inter sans-serif) via `next/font/google` is used uniformly across all headings and body text for a modern, clean, and consistent corporate aesthetic.

**Icons** — Font Awesome 6 Free loaded from CDN in `layout.tsx`

## Architecture Notes

### Why Tailwind CSS (not Vanilla CSS)
The project was migrated from Vanilla CSS to **Tailwind CSS v3**. Benefits:

- ✅ **No separate CSS files** — styles live directly in JSX `className` attributes
- ✅ **Consistent design tokens** — all colors defined once in `tailwind.config.ts`
- ✅ **Smaller bundle** — Tailwind's purge removes unused styles automatically
- ✅ **No naming collisions** — utility classes can't conflict across pages
- ✅ **Shared components** — `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` are reused across all pages, eliminating duplication

### Why the Products page is a pure Server Component
The `/products` page reads `?category=` using Next.js's `searchParams` server prop — **not** the `useSearchParams()` hook. This means:

- ✅ **Fully rendered on the server** — correct products are sent on first response
- ✅ **No Suspense boundary needed** — zero client/server hydration gap
- ✅ **No white flash** on navigation
- ✅ **SEO-friendly** — category URLs (`/products?category=food`) are crawlable

### Shared Components & UI Polish
Instead of repeating HTML across all 6 pages, core elements are extracted:
- `src/app/components/Header.tsx` — Dynamic component with animated growing gold underline for active navigation links. Features an integrated WhatsApp CTA button.
- `src/app/components/Footer.tsx` — Standardized 5-column CSS grid footer featuring detailed contact information, address details, and a centered copyright bar. Shared globally across all pages.

### Data & Assets
- **Product Descriptions:** The product catalogue is enriched with unique 2-line descriptions for all 19 products, providing better context directly on the product cards.
- **High-Quality Assets:** Low-resolution placeholder images (such as the 60+ Years seal and vintage storefront) have been replaced with premium, custom-generated high-resolution graphics to elevate the brand's perceived value.
- **Iconography:** FontAwesome 6 icons have been standardized and mapped precisely to their respective categories (e.g., `fa-pump-soap` for cleaning, `fa-utensils` for food, `fa-cubes` for inventory).
